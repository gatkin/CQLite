/**
* Add model to result list function type.
*
* Prototype of functions to add a model to a list of models being
* read from the results of a single query. The provided model_list
* will already be allocated to hold all of the results of the query.
* The next_model_list_idx indicates the index into the model list into
* which the row result from the query parameter is to be read as a model.
* These functions should NEVER alter the provided query (e.g. by calling
* sqlite3_step()) and should only ever read column results from it.
*
* These types of function should return 1 on success, 0 on error.
*
* Typically, all these functions should do is cast the model_list
* parameter to the appropriate type and call the corresponding
* cqlite_model_from_row_result_func_t defined for a particular model
* type. For instance, if we have a model type named my_model_t, and
* a cqlite_model_from_row_result_func_t function named my_model_from_query,
* then we would implement the my_model_t's cqlite_model_add_to_list_func_t
* function as
*
*       int my_model_add_to_list( sqlite3_stmt * query, void * model_list, int next_model_list_idx )
*       {
*       my_model_t * my_models;
*
*       my_models = (my_model_t*)model_list;
*
*       return my_model_from_query( query, &my_models[next_model_list_idx] );
*       }

* elements of the model list. Since model_list_out is allocated and
* initialized to all zeros, it should be safe to free all data in
* the model list even if an error occurs part way through reading
* the query results. The caller is always responsible for freeing
* the memory in model_list_out regardless of whether the function
* executes successfully.
* 
* The provided COUNT query string should retrieve the number of results
* that will be retrieved by the SELECT query string. For instance, if
* the select query string is:
* 
*         "SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE my_column = 7;"
*
